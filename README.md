# Overview

Barcode sequencing technology for functional screening
Barcode-seq is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique that reads genome-integrated artificial sequences called barcodes that specifically mark biological materials, such as cells or genes, with unique sequences [Smith et. al., 2009]. Having a unique barcode facilitates tracking materials of interest in genome-wide functional screens as well as the identification of drug targets or disease-associated genes [Carpenter et. al., 2004]. Currently, barcode-seq is used in several genome-wide screening tools, including shRNAs for gene knock-down [Sims et. al., 2011], sgRNAs for genome editing [Parnas et. al., 2015] and barcoded yeast deletion strains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe for gene knock-down or knock-out [Smith et. al., 2009; Kim et. al., 2010; Eason et. al., 2004]. The use of these tools for loss-of-function studies allows the discovery of relationships between genes and a specific environment without prior knowledge. Thus, barcode-seq is an effective system for genome-wide screening studies to comprehensively understand biological systems.
